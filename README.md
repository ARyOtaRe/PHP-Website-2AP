# Installation Guide
You need to have Wampserver or another similar installed on your computer.
You then need to link your folder to a virtualhost (it's explained [here](https://agence-web.cubis-helios.com/wamp-creer-un-nouveau-vhosts-domaine-sous-domaine/) ). You'll link it to your folder you downloaded from here.

You will then need to create a database called **"tutorial"** and a first table called **"users"**. You will then execute the command stated in the file `users.sql`.

That's it! You're up and running :)
