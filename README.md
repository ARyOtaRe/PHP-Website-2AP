# Installation Guide
You need to have Wampserver or another similar installed on your computer.
You then need to link your folder to a virtualhost (it's explained [here](https://agence-web.cubis-helios.com/wamp-creer-un-nouveau-vhosts-domaine-sous-domaine/) ). You'll link it to your folder you downloaded from here.

You will then need to create a database called **"tutorial"** and a first table called **"users"**. You will then execute the command stated in the file `users.sql`.

Then head up to email/sendEmail.php and edit lines 20 and 28 with your email address and line 21 with your password.
WARNING! ⚠ Google will ask you to enable "unsafe login" in order for the gmail SMTP service to work without any issues.

Launch your Apache server and...that's it! You're up and running :)
Just type "azerty" as username and "12345" as your password, and enjoy the ride :D
